# NRF52 PCA10056 Integration with Grove - 3-Axis Digital Accelerometer BMA400

This repository is dedicated to the integration of the nRF52 (PCA10056) Development Kit by Nordic Semiconductor with Seeed Studio's Grove - 3-Axis Digital Accelerometer BMA400. The BMA400 from Bosch Sensortec is an ultra-low power acceleration sensor with motion detection capabilities. 

This project enables the collection of high-precision acceleration data by combining the computational power of the nRF52 Development Kit and the sensitive tracking of the BMA400 Accelerometer. 

## Features
- I2C communication between nRF52 and BMA400
- Capture and process data in real time
- Includes power management features, leveraging the low-power mode of BMA400
- Configurable motion detection parameters

## Requirements
- Nordic Semiconductor nRF52 Development Kit (PCA10056)
- Grove - 3-Axis Digital Accelerometer BMA400

## Applications
Possible applications include IoT devices, wearable health monitoring systems, immersive gaming controls, and more. 
This project can be a foundation for any projects that need to incorporate motion or orientation detection in their functionality.
